###### My Journey started the last few months when Python got my attention.
###### I have always have fascination with computer and programming and I have decided to take a step forward.
###### I have joined a bootcamp recently for software engineering with Python as my main programming language.
###### So far so good! ðŸ˜„  The best part is that I still code after a 13 hour busy shift in A&E!
**âš¡This means that I have found my **passion**!âš¡
###### I am a keen and a fast learnerand I am a teamplayer!
###### The discipline and the soft skills I have gained in my curent profession will definitely help me
### In my new found journey as a Programmer!
